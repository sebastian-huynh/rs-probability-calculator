# Random Sample Probabilities With Python
This is one of the practices I completed for the "Scientific Computing with Python" certificate from freecodecamp.org. "test_module" and "main" were given, so I focused on creating the necessary Hat class and additional methods within the "prob_calculator" file. "prob_calculator" is then imported as a module into "main", which is necessary for the calculator to function. <br><br>
